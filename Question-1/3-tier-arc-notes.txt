I have created a simple 3-tier application with Presentation, application and Data Layer. 

1. I have deployed a public IP using which Clients can connect to the Web VM (where the application is dpeloyed , an application gateway and load balancer can be put in front of the public IP for additional security)
2. Adding an NSG rule in the presentation layer that allows RDP connections only from a safe set of public IP addresses.
3. Deploying a VM for the web and business tiers where the application would run.We Can also use VM scale set or availability set for better performance.
4. Deploying SQL server Database on the second VM segmented in the different subnet and secured with NSG in data Tier. 
5.Every Azure VM is deployed into a virtual network and is segmented into subnets.Creating a separate subnet for each tier.
